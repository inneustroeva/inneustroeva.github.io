Among linuxoids, it is famous for the fact that the most fashionable and advanced features appear in it before anyone else. For example, Fedora became one of the first versions of Linux to fully support Wayland, a modern interface rendering protocol.\nLast year, the distribution celebrated its twentieth anniversary. On this occasion, we decided to recall the history of its appearance and consider the features for which users love it so much.\nHow Fedora appeared In 1995, the IT company Red Hat released the first version of the paid enterprise Linux distribution ‚Äî RHEL, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It quickly gained popularity due to its high stability, which was noticeably higher than all alternatives available at that time.\nRHEL is a free distribution, but to use it in companies, you had to buy a subscription to technical support. Many users did not like this approach. At the same time, the project is based on the Linux kernel, that is, it has open source code ‚Äî anyone can take the sources and build their own variation of Red Hat.\nThis is exactly the idea that occurred to Warren Togami, a student at the University of Hawaii, in 2002. He created his own distribution package based on the Red Hat installation package as a project, adding relevant and stable programs to it. This is how Fedora Linux appeared.\nIn 2003, Red Hat joined the work on it ‚Äî the company funded the work, but left the development and development to the discretion of the community formed around it. This decision was part of the RHEL promotion strategy. The idea is simple ‚Äî to gain trust in the company and its projects through the distribution of a free and convenient distribution.\nThe decision turned out to be successful. The distribution quickly began to gain popularity and positive reviews from Linux users. Today, Fedora is consistently among the top 10 best Linux distributions, and the number of users exceeded 1 million people already in 2016.\nFedora Features Since it appeared a long time ago and continues to be supported, it has many features, but let‚Äôs focus on the main points:\nComes with standard GNOME\nOne of the biggest advantages is the standard GNOME desktop (an advanced desktop environment popular for Linux). Despite the fact that GNOME is one of the main Linux desktop environments, rare distributions have a standard version of it. Mostly GNOME comes with various modifications that try to mimic the graphical interface of the 90s.\nFedora provides one of the cleanest, most modern examples of GNOME.\nUser-friendly Many operating systems try to help new users adapt using graphical installers and welcome screens, but no one expected this from the free Fedora. Nevertheless, it supports ready-made Flatpak in addition to RPM files.\nProvides advanced software\nFedora is updated every 6 months, without the LTS version, so users receive current changes, the latest version of which is always the flagship.\nUnlike most competitors, Fedora delivers cutting-edge open source software. It was the first major distribution to switch from ext4 to Btrfs, from X11 to Wayland, from PulseAudio to PipeWire.\nReliable\nWhen fundamental changes are made to the Fedora, you can be sure that they are already ready for active mass use.\n","date":1715892449,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715892449,"objectID":"cedf8864a111fefdf7ffd6e0d574602b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/fedora/","publishdate":"2024-05-16T23:47:29+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/fedora/","section":"post","summary":"Fedora Workstation is one of the most widespread GNU/Linux distributions which is in the top 10 in popularity.

Everyone knows, scientific programming is an important field that involves the creation and use of software for scientific modeling, data analysis and computation. Many programming languages have been created for these purposes.\nWhat is scientific programming? Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by extreme correctness and stability of the final product, strict separation of scientific and interface parts, individuality of algorithms, and predominance of efficiency over universality.\nScientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without specialists in scientific programming, who are able to provide scientists with reliable and accurate tools for making discoveries.\nSpecializations Scientists use a variety of programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the author‚Äôs preferences. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many well-established libraries for mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations have been written in Fortran, which is relevant to economics and biology, respectively.\nA simpler syntax has Python, also suitable for programming mathematical computations. Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other ‚Äúscientific‚Äù languages: Fortran, C++, C#.\nIn turn, C# allows programming on the .NET platform, adapting a program to a common language runtime (CLR) and speeding up development in operational scientific sessions.\n","date":1714727757,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714727757,"objectID":"c72bb874addf0a7faec47748fc7157e3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/programming_and_science/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T12:15:57+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/programming_and_science/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction This post is dedicated to scientific programming languages.

Markdown is a text markup language created by writer and blogger John Gruber. It is designed to create beautifully designed texts in regular TXT files. You don‚Äôt need bulky processors like Word or Pages to create documents with bold or italics, citations, links, and even tables. It is enough to remember the simple rules of Markdown, and you can write even in a ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù. Although specialized Markdown editors are, of course, much more convenient.\nHow to use the markup language A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is a markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where it should be a title, and where the list is needed. You can use symbols to mark up headings, text selections, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a ready-made document based on the markup. It‚Äôs similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler, the text in it is more readable. Converters are either initially available in a text editor, for example in a note-taking application, or are downloaded separately.\nMarkup rules The basic syntax. It is very simple: the text is ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù in characters or they are placed before the line. This is how the headlines will look, for example.\n. # H1 header (first level, for example the title of the text)\n. ## H2 header (second level, headers)\n. ### H3 heading (third level, intermediate subheadings)\nBasic text formatting can be applied in the markdown. You won‚Äôt be able to insert a letter or a handwritten font, but it‚Äôs easy to highlight important areas.\n¬∑ Italics or cursive\n¬∑ Bold text or bold text\n¬∑ Bold and underlined text\n¬∑ \u0026gt; Quote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)\n¬∑ ‚Äî Bulleted list item\n¬∑ 1. The first item of the numbered list\n¬∑ 2. The second item of the numbered list (and so on)\nInserting materials Markup allows you to insert different elements into the text: links and images, which will then ‚Äúpull up‚Äù into the document when formatting is applied.\n¬∑ [link_text](any link) to insert links\n¬∑ [caption to the picture](link to the picture) to insert pictures into the text\n¬∑ ***, ‚Äî or ___ ‚Äî a horizontal line for the entire line that separates part of the text from another\nAnd if there should be an asterisk or any other ‚Äúspecial‚Äù character in the text that can be read incorrectly, you need to put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the symbol will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.\n","date":1712327054,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712327054,"objectID":"bd238f54b82fdcd586f8f7e438599565","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2024-04-05T17:24:14+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"What is Markdown?

As developers make changes to the project, you can restore any earlier version of it at any time.\nDevelopers can view the project log to find out the following:\nwhat changes have been made; who made the changes; what changes have been made; why the changes were needed. A GIT repository or project includes a complete set of files and folders associated with the project, as well as a change log of each file. The file log is presented as snapshots at specific points in time. These snapshots are called fixations. Commits can be organized along several lines of development, called branches. Since GIT is a distributed version control system, repositories are autonomous units and any user who has a copy of the repository can access the entire code base and its history. U sing the command line or other convenient interfaces, the following actions are also possible with the GIT repository: interacting with the log, cloning the repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes in different versions of the code, and much more.\nWhen working with GIT, developers use specific commands to copy, create, modify, and merge code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or using an application such as GitHub Desktop. Below are some common commands for working with GIT.\ngit init ‚Äî initializes a new GIT repository and starts tracking the existing directory. A hidden subfolder is added to the existing directory, which houses the internal data structure needed for version control.\ngit clone ‚Äî creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all project files, log and branches.\ngit add ‚Äî prepares the change. GIT tracks changes in the developer‚Äôs code base\ngit commit ‚Äî saves a snapshot in the project log and completes the change tracking process.\ngit status ‚Äî –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π: –Ω–µ –æ—Ç—Å–ª–µ–∂–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è, –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω—ã –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã.\ngit branch ‚Äî –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –≤–µ—Ç–≤–∏, —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º–∏ –≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞.\ngit merge ‚Äî –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Å–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –ª–∏–Ω–∏–π —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∏. –≠—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥–ª—è –æ–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π, –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ –¥–≤—É—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–µ—Ç–≤—è—Ö\ngit push ‚Äî –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–µ–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–π —Å —É—á–µ—Ç–æ–º —Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∞—Ü–∏–π, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ –≤–µ—Ç–≤–∏ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ.\nThere are two main ways to collaborate on GitHub:\nshared repository; creating forks and pulling. In the case of a shared repository, individual users and teams are explicitly assigned by participants with read, write, or administrative access. T his simple permission structure, combined with features such as protected branches, helps teams get started quickly after implementing GitHub.\nFor open source projects or projects in which any user can participate, managing individual permissions can be a daunting task. In this case, a fork-and-pull model is more convenient, which allows everyone who can view the project to participate in it. A fork is a copy of the project in the developer‚Äôs personal account. Each developer has full control over the fork and is free to implement a fix or a new feature. The results of work in forks are either stored separately or transferred back to the original project using a pull request.\n","date":1710367334,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710367334,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/git/","publishdate":"2024-03-14T01:02:14+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Version control Git","tags":[],"title":"Git","type":"post"},{"authors":["Irina Neustroeva"],"categories":[],"content":"This week has been productive Thank you for reading this post.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
