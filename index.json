Creating reports in markdown is one of the easiest ways to save your time.\nEvery week we do laboratory work. Then we should prepare a report on our labs. We perform reports for laboratory work in the lightweight markup language markdown.\nWhat is MARKDOWN?✨😉 Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.\nHow do we execute the report? ❓ For each laboratory work, we have a template that we need to fill in with all the necessary information. The title page of the report contains information about the number of the lab, the topic and the author of the report. Next, we describe the purpose of the laboratory work, the task, as well as a theoretical introduction. And then the description of the main part of the work begins. Description of the work. We should describe the accomplishment of the work as fully and clearly as possible. To do this, we can divide the stages into several parts, insert screenshots and add a description, etc.\n","date":1713380539,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713380539,"objectID":"677b480c0a60831b4e4ce258e50b5ccc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/report/","publishdate":"2024-04-17T22:02:19+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/report/","section":"post","summary":"Let’s talk about the report 📋✏️ Each project requires a report to summarize all the information and work.

Markdown is a text markup language created by writer and blogger John Gruber. It is designed to create beautifully designed texts in regular TXT files. You don’t need bulky processors like Word or Pages to create documents with bold or italics, citations, links, and even tables. It is enough to remember the simple rules of Markdown, and you can write even in a “Notebook”. Although specialized Markdown editors are, of course, much more convenient.\nHow to use the markup language A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is a markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where it should be a title, and where the list is needed. You can use symbols to mark up headings, text selections, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a ready-made document based on the markup. It’s similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler, the text in it is more readable. Converters are either initially available in a text editor, for example in a note-taking application, or are downloaded separately.\nMarkup rules The basic syntax. It is very simple: the text is “wrapped” in characters or they are placed before the line. This is how the headlines will look, for example.\n. # H1 header (first level, for example the title of the text)\n. ## H2 header (second level, headers)\n. ### H3 heading (third level, intermediate subheadings)\nBasic text formatting can be applied in the markdown. You won’t be able to insert a letter or a handwritten font, but it’s easy to highlight important areas.\n· Italics or cursive\n· Bold text or bold text\n· Bold and underlined text\n· \u0026gt; Quote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)\n· — Bulleted list item\n· 1. The first item of the numbered list\n· 2. The second item of the numbered list (and so on)\nInserting materials Markup allows you to insert different elements into the text: links and images, which will then “pull up” into the document when formatting is applied.\n· [link_text](any link) to insert links\n· [caption to the picture](link to the picture) to insert pictures into the text\n· ***, — or ___ — a horizontal line for the entire line that separates part of the text from another\nAnd if there should be an asterisk or any other “special” character in the text that can be read incorrectly, you need to put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the symbol will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.\n","date":1712327054,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712327054,"objectID":"bd238f54b82fdcd586f8f7e438599565","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2024-04-05T17:24:14+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"What is Markdown?

As developers make changes to the project, you can restore any earlier version of it at any time.\nDevelopers can view the project log to find out the following:\nwhat changes have been made; who made the changes; what changes have been made; why the changes were needed. A GIT repository or project includes a complete set of files and folders associated with the project, as well as a change log of each file. The file log is presented as snapshots at specific points in time. These snapshots are called fixations. Commits can be organized along several lines of development, called branches. Since GIT is a distributed version control system, repositories are autonomous units and any user who has a copy of the repository can access the entire code base and its history. U sing the command line or other convenient interfaces, the following actions are also possible with the GIT repository: interacting with the log, cloning the repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes in different versions of the code, and much more.\nWhen working with GIT, developers use specific commands to copy, create, modify, and merge code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or using an application such as GitHub Desktop. Below are some common commands for working with GIT.\ngit init — initializes a new GIT repository and starts tracking the existing directory. A hidden subfolder is added to the existing directory, which houses the internal data structure needed for version control.\ngit clone — creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all project files, log and branches.\ngit add — prepares the change. GIT tracks changes in the developer’s code base\ngit commit — saves a snapshot in the project log and completes the change tracking process.\ngit status — выводит состояние изменений: не отслеживаются, изменены или подготовлены.\ngit branch — показывает ветви, с которыми ведется локальная работа.\ngit merge — выполняет слияние линий разработки. Эта команда обычно применяется для объединения изменений, внесенных в двух разных ветвях\ngit push — обновляет удаленный репозиторий с учетом фиксаций, выполненных в ветви локально.\nThere are two main ways to collaborate on GitHub:\nshared repository; creating forks and pulling. In the case of a shared repository, individual users and teams are explicitly assigned by participants with read, write, or administrative access. T his simple permission structure, combined with features such as protected branches, helps teams get started quickly after implementing GitHub.\nFor open source projects or projects in which any user can participate, managing individual permissions can be a daunting task. In this case, a fork-and-pull model is more convenient, which allows everyone who can view the project to participate in it. A fork is a copy of the project in the developer’s personal account. Each developer has full control over the fork and is free to implement a fix or a new feature. The results of work in forks are either stored separately or transferred back to the original project using a pull request.\n","date":1710367334,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710367334,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/git/","publishdate":"2024-03-14T01:02:14+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Version control Git","tags":[],"title":"Git","type":"post"},{"authors":["Irina Neustroeva"],"categories":[],"content":"This week has been productive Thank you for reading this post.
