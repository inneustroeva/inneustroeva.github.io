      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-the-report-&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the report üìã‚úèÔ∏è&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each project requires a report to summarize all the information and work. Creating reports in markdown is one of the easiest ways to save your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week we do laboratory work. Then we should prepare a report on our labs. We perform reports for laboratory work in the lightweight markup language markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-markdown&#34;&gt;What is MARKDOWN?‚ú®üòâ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-we-execute-the-report-&#34;&gt;How do we execute the report? ‚ùì&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each laboratory work, we have a template that we need to fill in with all the necessary information.
The title page of the report contains information about the number of the lab, the topic and the author of the report. Next, we describe the purpose of the laboratory work, the task, as well as a theoretical introduction.
And then the description of the main part of the work begins. Description of the work.
We should describe the accomplishment of the work as fully and clearly as possible. To do this, we can divide the stages into several parts, insert screenshots and add a description, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a good week. First of all, I have completed the first stage of the control work. We started new topics in matanalysis and mathematical logic, I successfully completed laboratory tests on operating systems and did a lot of homework in other subjects. üìñüìù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also a model at the final stage of the All-Russian Technology Olympiad. I had a pale blue beautiful dress in the style of Russian fairy talesüëó&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I managed to go to the Moscow Zoo and take beautiful photos.üêº&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-have-i-spent-this-week&#34;&gt;How have I spent this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post. I would like to tell you how I spent this week.This week has been difficult and very productive. I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for a mathematical logic test all week. For me, this is not an easy subject, so I have been solving various tasks for a long time and a lot. This week I found out that I wrote the matanalysis test very well, which I am very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I wrote a test paper on the Spanish language and, according to my feeling, everything went fine, I hope for a good result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And over the weekend, I managed to take gorgeous photos on the streets of Moscow with my friend. A real spring has begun in Moscow, the sun has come out and the snow has melted. The mood is wonderful and I want to spend as much time outside as possible.üå∫‚òÄÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%8F/git/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 01:02:14 +0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;version-control-git&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Version control Git&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version control system tracks the history of changes in the process of collaboration on projects.
As developers make changes to the project, you can restore any earlier version of it at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can view the project log to find out the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what changes have been made;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who made the changes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what changes have been made;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why the changes were needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GIT repository or project includes a complete set of files and folders associated with the project, as well as a change log of each file.
The file log is presented as snapshots at specific points in time. These snapshots are called fixations.
Commits can be organized along several lines of development, called branches.
Since GIT is a distributed version control system, repositories are autonomous units and any user who has a copy of the repository can access the entire code base and its history. U
sing the command line or other convenient interfaces, the following actions are also possible with the GIT repository:
interacting with the log, cloning the repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes in different versions of the code, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with GIT, developers use specific commands to copy, create, modify, and merge code.
These commands can be executed directly from the command line or using an application such as GitHub Desktop.
Below are some common commands for working with GIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git init ‚Äî initializes a new GIT repository and starts tracking the existing directory.
A hidden subfolder is added to the existing directory, which houses the internal data structure needed for version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git clone ‚Äî creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely.
The clone includes all project files, log and branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git add ‚Äî prepares the change. GIT tracks changes in the developer&amp;rsquo;s code base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git commit ‚Äî saves a snapshot in the project log and completes the change tracking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git status ‚Äî –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π: –Ω–µ –æ—Ç—Å–ª–µ–∂–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è, –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω—ã –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git branch ‚Äî –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –≤–µ—Ç–≤–∏, —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º–∏ –≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git merge ‚Äî –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Å–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –ª–∏–Ω–∏–π —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∏. –≠—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥–ª—è –æ–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π, –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ –¥–≤—É—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–µ—Ç–≤—è—Ö&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git push ‚Äî –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–µ–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–π —Å —É—á–µ—Ç–æ–º —Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∞—Ü–∏–π, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ –≤–µ—Ç–≤–∏ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways to collaborate on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared repository;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating forks and pulling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a shared repository, individual users and teams are explicitly assigned by participants with read, write, or administrative access. T
his simple permission structure, combined with features such as protected branches, helps teams get started quickly after implementing GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For open source projects or projects in which any user can participate, managing individual permissions can be a daunting task. In this case, a fork-and-pull model is more convenient, which allows everyone who can view the project to participate in it. A fork is a copy of the project in the developer&amp;rsquo;s personal account. Each developer has full control over the fork and is free to implement a fix or a new feature. The results of work in forks are either stored separately or transferred back to the original project using a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post. I would like to tell you how I spent this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very productive this week.
I managed to do my homework, I did the cleaning lady, the boys also congratulated us on March 8 and presented us with a box of chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I plan to be more productive and have time to meet with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
